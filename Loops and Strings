/*
  Loops in JavaScript
  Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
*/

/* 1. for Loop */
// The for loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times.

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
}

/* 2. while Loop */
// The while loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.

let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    console.log(i); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
    i++;
}

/* 3. do...while Loop */
// The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.

let j = 1;
do {
    console.log(j); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
    j++;
} while (j <= 5);

/* 4. for...in Loop */
// The for...in loop iterates over the properties of an object.

let person = { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" };

for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]); 
    // Output: name: John, age: 30, city: New York
}

/* 5. for...of Loop */
// The for...of loop iterates over iterable objects like arrays, strings, etc.

let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];

for (let fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit); // Output: Apple Banana Mango
}
