Operators in JavaScript
Operators in JavaScript are symbols used to perform operations on values and variables.

1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations.

Operator  Description		      Example
+	        Addition		        5 + 2 = 7
-	        Subtraction		      5 - 2 = 3
*	        Multiplication      5 * 2 = 10
/	        Division		        5 / 2 = 2.5
%	        Modulus (remainder) 5 % 2 = 1
++	      Increment	          let x = 5; x++ = 6
--	      Decrement	        	let x = 5; x-- = 4

2. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Decription		             Example
=		      Assigns value		           x = 10
+=	      Adds and assigns	         x += 5 (x = x + 5)
-=	      Subtracts and assigns	     x -= 5 (x = x - 5)
*=	      Multiplies and assigns	   x *= 5 (x = x * 5)
/=	      Divides and assigns	       x /= 5 (x = x / 5)

3. Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

Operator	Description			            Example
==		Equal to		                  	5 == "5" (true)
===		Strict equal (value & type)	    5 === "5" (false)
!=		Not equal			5 != "6" (true)
!==		Strict not equal		5 !== "5" (true)
>		Greater than			5 > 2 (true)
<		Less than			5 < 2 (false)
>=		Greater than or equal to	5 >= 2 (true)
<=		Less than or equal to		5 <= 2 (false)

4. Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine or invert boolean expressions.

Operator	Description		Example
&&		Logical AND		(5 > 2) && (3 < 4) (true)		`
!		Logical NOT		!(5 > 2) (false)

5. Ternary Operator
The ternary operator is a shorthand for conditional statements.

Syntax:
condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse

Example:
let age = 18;
let canVote = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";
console.log(canVote); // Output: "Yes"
